Command to run:
./maximum-resident > sample-output.txt

In my maximum-resident.c file the global variable TOTAL_BYTES 65536 or 64 kilobytes. 
which is 16 pages. If you look at the output in sample-output.txt after forcing the
pages to be resident the number of resident pages and private resident pages increase
from 15 to 31. This is the expected increase of 16 pages. Furthermore, the forcing to
be resident is efficiently done as it is copying in only one byte into the first
byte of every page.
