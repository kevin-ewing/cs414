Command to run:
sudo dtrace -s page-faults.d -c ./page-faults > sample-output.txt

In the documentation for the FTB provider probes it lists the first argument of the 
vm_fault_trap entry probe to be the requested address. Furthermore, the first argument of
vm_fault_trap return probe is the return value of the kernel function vm_fault_trap() 
which “KERN_SUCCESS is returned if the page fault is handled: otherwise, a standard error
specifying why the fault is fatal is returned”. KERN_SUCCESS is 0. Therefore if 0 is the 
first argument of all vm_fault_trap:return probes that are successful all others failed.

In the sample output we can see that all of the page faults are handled successfully except
for the last one which returns arg1 = 0x1. This happens when requesting the address 
0x800a55000 (aka arg1 of the vm_fault_trap:entry) which is outside the mapping created by 
mmap.
