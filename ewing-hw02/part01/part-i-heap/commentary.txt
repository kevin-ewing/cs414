The above is the mapping found on lines 15, 33, and 50 is the mapping that contains the 
heap. We know this for two reasons. First because when we print the pointer to the heap
at the begging out the program and at the top of sample-output.txt we see that the pointer
is to the memory location 0x800e13000. This pointer is in the range as specified by the
example above. Secondly, we also know it is the correct location because after we write
to the malloc pointer a new page is linked and so the resident page size should increase
in the mapping that the heap is in. We see this as well. Before the malloc the memory map
has 15 resident pages and 15 private resident pages. After the malloc the memory map has
17 resident pages and 17 private resident pages. Therefore the ranges 0x800c00000-
0x801400000 therefore contain the heap
