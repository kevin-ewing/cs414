Command to run:
sudo dtrace -s page-fault-timer.d -c ./swap-this > sample-output.txt

We know that swapping is occurring because the number of paged out pages is increasing
after we force this swap.

Before forcing the swap:
        1 swap pager pageins
        1 swap pager pages paged in
     2395 swap pager pageouts
    58886 swap pager pages paged out

After forcing the swap:
        1 swap pager pageins
        1 swap pager pages paged in
     4264 swap pager pageouts
    92124 swap pager pages paged out

Once we know that the swapping is in fact happening we can turn our attention to the 
difference in time that it takes for a page to be swapped out as compared to one that
is not. By viewing the distribution of swapping times by looking at the dtrace 
quantized output we can see that there is no significant time impact on paging out a
page. This is slightly surprising however it can also be explained by the techniques
talked about in the paper we read: translation caching: skip, don't walk
