The above is the mapping found on lines 9 and 26 is the mapping that contains the 
mapping created by mmap. We know this for two reasons. First because when we print the 
pointer to the mmap in sample-output.txt we see that the pointer is to the memory location 
0x800641000. This pointer is in the range as specified by the example above. 
Secondly, we also know it is the correct location because after we write to the memory map
pointer a new page is linked and so the resident page size should increase for the chunk that
the mmap mapping is in. We see this as well. Before the mmap write the chunk had 25 resident
pages and 25 private resident pages. After the write and creating of the entry in the TLB 
the memory map has 26 resident pages and 26 private resident pages. Therefore the ranges 
of the mapping are 0x80061e000-0x800642000 which is at a slightly lower memory address than
the heap which is found in the 0x800c00000-0x801400000 range.
