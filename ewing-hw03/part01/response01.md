## Part I: Implementation
---
I need new music. Send me a link to at least one and no more than three songs you like. Links must be accessible without signing up for anything. Do not try to predict what I might like: Iâ€™m looking for new stuff here. I do not judge people on their musical preferences. Sincere recommendations only: rickrolling or similar will earn an instant F.
