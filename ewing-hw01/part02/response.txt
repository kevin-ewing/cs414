What does Linuxâ€™s futex_waitv system call do?
    The new futex_waitv system call is a part of the new futex2 group of system calls as 
    an improvement to the originals. These system calls allow "userspace to create 
    performant synchronization mechanisms." What futex_waitv does is that it waits on an 
    array of futexs (up to 128) and wakes on any of them. If a futex is woken then the 
    function returns the index of that waked futex.

How does it differ from the existing futex(2) syscall?
    Futex2 is a followup version of the initial futex syscalls that have the following 
    improvements: NUMA awareness operations (where NUMA-awareness is allowing the 
    software to take advantage of separate cores clusters where each core cluster has its
    own local memory while still letting cores access all memory in the system.), Support
    for 8, 16, 32 and 64 bit sizes, and finally the futex2 will allow waiting on multiple 
    futexes (as we are looking at with futex_waitv)

What software is expected to immediately make use of futex_waitv and for what purpose?
    Wine and Proton are expected to make use of futex_waitv. These are two emulator
    softwares for Windows and will use futex_wiatv in order to be able to easily match
    Windows' WaitForMultipleObjects system call. This will allow the emulation software
    to be more efficient.

What is the higher-level purpose this software fulfills and (again, at a high level) how 
does it fulfill it?
    Wine's larger purpose is to allow users to run Windows targeted applications on linux 
    machines. It does this by converting system calls from ones that are recognized and
    designed for windows to system calls that are available on linux. It makes these 
    adjustments on the fly as the windows application is running. Furthermore, if the 
    application attempts to do something that is not a simple conversion to another system
    call Wine will translate that call into a series of steps that Linux can manage first.
    before preforming the desired tasks. Furthermore, Wine also mimics the filesystem 
    structure of windows to the application, and also provides the applications with 
    linux implementations of Windows system libraries.
